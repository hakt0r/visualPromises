<!--
    Create a function that makes a visual promise.

        - Should take a certain amount of time
            just like yesterdays exercise it should resolve
            or reject based on the parameter

        - When your promise is created it shoud add a <div>
            with a yellow background to signlify it's pending
            when your promise resolves or rejects
            it should change its color to
                     red (rejected)
                or green (resolved)

    It should be used like this:
        VisualPromise(true)  // << should resolve
        VisualPromise(false) // << should reject
        .catch( error => console.log(error) )

    Bonus: create an async function instead of the Promise
            that does the same (hint: you will still need Sleep() )
